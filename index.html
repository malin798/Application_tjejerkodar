      <p> 
      Mob programming is, according to <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/" target="_blank"> Agilealliance</a>, an approach in software development where the whole team works in the same project. 
      The team collaborates and works at the same time and on the same computer. 
  
      This type of collaboration can significantly reduce problems in communication, such as waiting for other people to answer questions or emails.
      It can also reduce the risk of misunderstandings arising from communication via email or documentation. 

        <h3>
        "Mob programming can also aid decision making processes, as the team often view them as an opportunity to learn and make a better solution 
         for the product" 
        </h3>

      The many sets of eyes also have a higher chance of spotting any faults in the product which can lead to a technical debt in the future, 
      and slow the progress of the current work. This is why mob programming can make the finished product easier to maintain in the future.
  
      However, this type of collaboration in the team will only work if the team values this approach and choose to work this way. 
      Because mob programming demands commitment it will not be nearly as effective if the team is forced to make the change.

      <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/" target="_blank">Hackernoon</a> believes the team can move the forward faster, if done correctly.  
      Everybody needs to fully understand the work and what is being done. If somebody doesn’t fully understand what is being done, 
      the team member needs to ask questions to clarify and regain the context. 
      That is why mob programming doesn’t work for all teams, for the approach to work effectively everyone needs to be 
      comfortable asking questions in front of the whole team.

      <h3>
        Mob programming is pair programming taken one step further. The entire team gathers around one (preferably big) screen, 
        take turns sitting at the keyboard, and work on a problem together. Knowledge sharing increased by bounds and leaps
